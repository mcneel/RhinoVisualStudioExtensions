## Features

This extension provides add-on and component wizards for RhinoCommon and Grasshopper projects in C# and VB.NET, and wizards for the Rhino C++ SDK. For RhinoCommon and C++ project templates, this includes utility, digitizier, import and export plug-ins. For Grasshopper project templates, this includes a spiral for an Archimedean spiral component.

It makes setting up debugging easier and automatically references the RhinoCommon and/or Grasshopper NuGet packages. Rhino and Grasshopper are requirements for this wizard to operate correctly.
